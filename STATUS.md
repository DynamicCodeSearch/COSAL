We are applying for the **Available** badge at ICSE'20 artifact track. We believe our submission deserves the badge due to the following reasons
* The source code for our tool SLACC is publically available on [Github](https://github.com/DynamicCodeSearch/COSAL). 
* We have documented the setup for the tool in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/DynamicCodeSearch/SLACC/blob/COSAL/INSTALL.md) and provided a preconfigured virtualbox image where SLACC can be run on new and existing datasets.
* We have provided the data used in this study in our paper publicly in the github repository.
